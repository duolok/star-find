### Usage
After you create a grid, you will need to set the start coordinates and the end points. Start and End points are marked in blue. Add obstacles by holding left-click and hovering over the grid. To remove obstacles, click on them. Once satisfied, click 'Visualize' to find a path. If no path is available, adjust the grid as needed.
